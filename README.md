## 1.1. Workshops

January 31, 2019

### 1.1.1. Visualizing Git

#### 1.1.1.1. Speaker

Katrina Uychaco

- Software Engineer, GitHub
- github.com/kuychaco
- kuychaco@github.com

#### 1.1.1.2. Notes

Branches are refs and commits are not deleted if you delete a branch like `master`.

- [Git visualization tool](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)

- Command `head~2` point to 2 commits back.

No fast-forward:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature
$ git commit
$ git checkout master
$ git merge feature-branch --no-ff
```

Move commits from a feature branch to the master branch:

```bash
$ git commit
$ git checkout -b feature
$ git commit
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout feature
$ git merge master
$ git rebase master
$ git reflog
```

Pushing to and pulling from remote: basically merges and rebases between branches.

Pull = fetch + merge (fast fwd)

Force pushing to rewrite history on remote:

```bash
$ git push --force
```

Amend commit message:

```bash
$ git commit --amend -m "fixed message"
```

Revert a commit: creates a new commit reverting changes from previous commit:

```bash
$ git revert head
```

Cherry-picking commits

### 1.1.2. Git hooks, aliases, and bears oh my

#### 1.1.2.1. Speaker

Mike Corsaro

- Windows Developer, Atlassian
- @F0DA

#### 1.1.2.2. Notes

- [Repo with all content](https://bitbucket.org/MikeCorsaro/git-scripts/src/master/)

##### Aliases

- [Aliases folder](https://bitbucket.org/MikeCorsaro/git-scripts/src/a9238748c6a891fdab447b5b58af8542a39a8ad7/aliases/?at=master)
- [Other Useful aliases (not from the talk)](https://github.com/lee-dohm/dotfiles/blob/8d3c59004154571578c2b32df2cdebb013517630/gitconfig#L8)

In aliases, you can add a `!` to run bash commands in the alias, e.g.:  `!git status`

You can add a script folder (and version it) and add to your `$PATH`.

##### Hooks

Automate things on git events. Client-side and server-side hooks possible.

Hooks are harder to version, because they live inside the `.git/hooks` folder.

### 1.1.3. Deep clean your Git repos (with LFS)

#### 1.1.3.1. Speaker

Lars Schneider

- Service Account Engineer, Github

Prem Kumar Ponuthorai

- Trainer, GitHub


#### 1.1.3.2. Notes

Content:

1. How Git works internally (also w/ LFS)
2. How to find large files/dirs in Git repos
3. How to purge files from Git repos

##### Why and how git stores things

Why make git repos smaller? Storage, performance, improve workflows.

Hashing. SHA1 explanation.

Example:

```bash
$ echo 'some text' | git hash-object --stdin

7b57bd29ea8afbdeb9bac64cf7074f4b531492a8
```

Git default deduplication using hashes.

##### How to handle large files

Example with changes in binary files such as media:

- Code: 1MB
- Media: 100MB

Even tiny changes to the binary file add another 100MB to the size of the repo. Two changes mean 301MB repo.

Problem really happens in large-scale settings: 
a 301MB repo cloned by 100 devs: 30GB network usage.

LFS server:

```bash
$ git lfs install
$ git lfs track "*.mp4"
$ git lfs ls-files
```

Goes to `.gitattributes` file.

Git lfs migrate.

##### Exercises

###### Exercise 1

- Fork and clone: https://github.com/universeworkshops/deep-clean-exercise1
  - Even though just one text file in the latest commit, repo has 1MB.

```bash
$ du -hs .git/objects

1.0M	.git/objects

$ git cat-file --batch-all-objects --batch-check

03f04d1a50eeb4c831e925b9de9983e3547b496e blob 106

130e75bcec86843476a7caadf460add6820ee360 tree 70
7c2b6b0c5faad8cd3f6231b6abbfa87b2882e93b commit 239
b26d812218ce88965b56fa5a5112fc67f941283b blob 1024000  <-- big blob!
b69a1bd969b4b6a581d62a0a43a0d3d71983f3fa blob 96

fddc5e0867190869523329b0a3690e6d4bc85358 commit 246

$ git rev-list --all --objects

fddc5e0867190869523329b0a3690e6d4bc85358
7c2b6b0c5faad8cd3f6231b6abbfa87b2882e93b
e73f2010475f2bec4a483d8d78cc49da0d678353
b88ca904dac19a19e90ac0a0764d2cc6dc8414ec
03f04d1a50eeb4c831e925b9de9983e3547b496e main.c
12b95dbeb2e6a8a75fdb12ce9c86707e5658f1f3
b26d812218ce88965b56fa5a5112fc67f941283b tool.exe
130e75bcec86843476a7caadf460add6820ee360
b69a1bd969b4b6a581d62a0a43a0d3d71983f3fa main.c
```

- Clone: https://github.com/larsxschneider/git-repo-analysis
- Run: `git-find-large-files`

```bash
$ ./git-find-large-files

1000  Deleted  tool.exe
```

###### Exercise 2

Remove cached via git:

```bash
$ git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch tool.exe' -- --all

Rewrite e73f2010475f2bec4a483d8d78cc49da0d678353 (1/3) (0 seconds passed, remaining 0 predicted)    rm 'tool.exe'
Rewrite 7c2b6b0c5faad8cd3f6231b6abbfa87b2882e93b (2/3) (0 seconds passed, remaining 0 predicted)    rm 'tool.exe'
Rewrite fddc5e0867190869523329b0a3690e6d4bc85358 (3/3) (0 seconds passed, remaining 0 predicted)
Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
Ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master' was rewritten
WARNING: Ref 'refs/remotes/origin/master' is unchanged
```

That above is slow. Alternative from git-repo-analysis:

`git-purge-files '/tool\.exe$'`

Tip: always enable branch protection.

###### Exercise 3

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/$YOUR-USERNAME/deep-clean-exercise1.git

$ git lfs migrate info --everything

migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Examining commits: 100% (3/3), done
*.exe	1.0 MB	1/1 files(s)	100%
*.c  	202 B 	2/2 files(s)	100%

$ git lfs migrate import --everything --include="*.exe"

migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Rewriting commits: 100% (3/3), done
  master	fddc5e0867190869523329b0a3690e6d4bc85358 -> 0401299ea1603d42641a29d9f060ff5a1d59c75f
migrate: Updating refs: ..., done

```

###### Q&A

In GitHub, if the original repo is deleted, content gets copied to fork.

### 1.1.4. Git Legit

#### 1.1.4.1. Speaker

Speaker: Pauline Vos

- Software Engineer, Werkspot

#### 1.1.4.2. Notes

##### "Atomic" commits

1. So small you can't divide it. Pertains to one fix or feature.
2. Everything works. Don't break builds.
3. Clear and concise

Problem? See http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/

##### Exercise

Clone & run: https://github.com/paulinevos/money

```bash
$ git checkout 1_amend
Branch '1_amend' set up to track remote branch '1_amend' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch '1_amend'
```

Make a simple change and stage the change w/ add, then:

```bash
git commit --amend
[1_amend 239402f] Update README with setup instructions
 Author: Pauline Vos <pvos88@gmail.com>
 Date: Sat Jan 26 10:37:00 2019 +0100
 1 file changed, 36 insertions(+)
```

With `--amend`, you must force push because you're rewriting history.

```bash
$ git rebase -i HEAD~4

pick 44fa399 Fix division causing unnecessary fractional parts (#495)
pick 8655b0f Update change log
pick 4990791 Change Docker setup for Git workshop
pick 239402f Update README with setup instructions

# Rebase 1ec3b8e..239402f onto 1ec3b8e (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
```

Make different changes to previous commits:

```bash
$ git checkout 2_rebase
Branch '2_rebase' set up to track remote branch '2_rebase' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch '2_rebase'

$ code README.md  # making changes to a file

$ git stash

Saved working directory and index state WIP on 2_rebase: d2c0cef Updated currencies (#479)

$ git rebase -i HEAD~8

Stopped at 43ad4f8...  Fix risky tests
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue

$  git rebase --continue

[detached HEAD 6449588] Update change log 123
 Author: Mark Sagi-Kazar <mark.sagikazar@gmail.com>
 Date: Wed Sep 12 17:09:03 2018 +0200
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
Stopped at 74cdd03...  Fix annotations (#491)
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue

$ git rebase --continue

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/2_rebase.
```

Clean-up from previous "late night" commits, making into atomic commits:

```bash
$ git checkout 3_cleanup

Branch '3_cleanup' set up to track remote branch '3_cleanup' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch '3_cleanup'

$ git log --oneline

$git reset HEAD~

Unstaged changes after reset:
M	composer.json
M	src/Currencies/BitcoinCurrencies.php
M	src/Currencies/CurrencyList.php
M	tests/Exchange/IndirectExchangeTest.php

$ git status

On branch 3_cleanup
Your branch is behind 'origin/3_cleanup' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   composer.json
	modified:   src/Currencies/BitcoinCurrencies.php
	modified:   src/Currencies/CurrencyList.php
	modified:   tests/Exchange/IndirectExchangeTest.php

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git log --oneline

$ git add composer.json

$ git commit -m "dependencies"

[3_cleanup 8bdbb4c] dependencies
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

$ git add tests/Exchange/IndirectExchangeTest.php

$ git rebase -i HEAD~10

Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/3_cleanup.
```

##### How to write good commit messages

https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 3. Capitalize the subject line
> 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

+# Git
+
 Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

 Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

-Branching and Merging
+### Branching and Merging
 The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.

 Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

 This means that you can do things like:

-Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.
-Role-Based Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.
-Feature Based Workflow. Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
-Disposable Experimentation. Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the workâ€”with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).
